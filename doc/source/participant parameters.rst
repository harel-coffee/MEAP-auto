These are variables you can include. 
	1. **age** 
	2. **gender** M= male, F= female
	3. weight = lbs
	4. height_ft = Subject's height in feet
	5. height_in = Subject's height in inches
	6. electrode_distance_front = Impedance electrode distance (front)
	7. electrode_distance_back = Impedance electrode distance (back)
	8. electrode_distance_right = Impedance electrode distance (right)
	9. electrode_distance_left =Impedance electrode distance (left)
	10. resp_max = Respiration circumference max (cm)
	11. resp_min = Respiration circumference min (cm)
	12. in_mri = True or False
	13. control_base_impedance = If in MRI, stores the z0 value from outside the MRI since this 
		value is impacted by scanning.
